Here we will do a short exploration of the properties of a hydrogen
molecule using PIMC++.

Earlier in the week we computed properties of the hydrogen molecule
using Variational Monte Carlo. As another example of the sort of
problems PIMC++ can do, we can compute the Energy of a hydrogen
molecule. Look in the file \\(H2.in\\)

This file has been set up to calculate the energy and pair correlation
function of an H2 molecule. Skim through this file. There are a couple
of key differences between this file and the helium file. Notice the way
that two species (protons and electrons) are setup. In this case, we
have set the protons to be classical particles (by setting lambda to
0.0). Also, inside the action section, a series of PairActions exist for
the coulumb action.

To run this code, we should call

    pimc++ H2.in

(do this now)

Once the code has run, you can again analyze the data by calling

    Report.py H2.0.h5

For this simulation we are using a bondlength of approximately 1.4
although it should be reasonably clear how to modify this.

You should notice the following things:

1.  the energy you get is within error bars of the correct answer of
    -1.1744.
2.  that the kinetic and potential energy obey the virial theorem:
    \\(\langle V \rangle = -2\langle K \rangle\\). Note that this should
    only be true for coloumb systems

Note, the difference in the input between Variational Monte Carlo and
Path Integral Monte Carlo. In the VMC calculation from Monday, we needed
to guess a trial wave function and the quality of our result was
dependent on this trial function. In PIMC, the only input is the coloumb
potential (1/r), the bond length of the particles, and the temperature
(which we currently have set sufficiently small to ensure we are in the
ground state.) From this information, we are able to get the exact
result. (Of course, if you were doing a simulation that involved many
fermions, this is no longer true as you would need a trial wave function
(density matrix) to specify the nodal restriction. Nonetheless, the
dependence will still be smaller then in VMC.)

Now, let us visualize our simulation.

Call

    pathvis++ H2.0.h5

You should see a graphical representation of the paths as well as the
location of the ions. One interesting thing to note is that at this bond
length, one can't tell from looking at the electron paths that there are
two point charges instead of one point charge. In fact, everything looks
largely spherical. This should give us good indication that using a
trial function with a bond centered gaussian is physically very
reasonable.

At this point, you are free to explore different things. Possible things
to look at include

1.  energy as a function of bond length
2.  what temperature the molecule breaks down. This requires:
    1.  making the protons quantum (i.e. putting the correct value for
        lambda in the proton species section)
    2.  adding moves for the protons (Displace and BisectionBlock)
    3.  calling these moves in the \\(Algorithm\\) section.

If you are interested, we would be happy to help get you started in
implementing these steps.
